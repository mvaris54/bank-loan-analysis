## 💡 Insights

- **Debt consolidation** is the most common loan purpose  
- Fully Paid loans contribute the highest share of amount received  
- Borrowers with higher **DTI** tend to fall in bad loan category  
- 36-month term loans are more common than 60-month  
- Interest rate plays a major role in loan performance  
- Some states consistently show higher funded amounts
